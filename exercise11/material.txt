- multiple inheritane basics
- example: 
	- abstract base class Developer
	- derived classes FrontendDeveloper and BackendDeveloper
	- class FullstackDeveloper, inheriting both FrontendDeveloper and BackendDeveloper
- problems with FullstackDeveloper:
	- how many developers (one coming from FrontendDeveloper, one coming from BackendDeveloper)? #1
	- which method to use? #2
- virtual base class - fixing our problem #1
- fixing our problem #2 - protected method Data (see class hierarchy)
