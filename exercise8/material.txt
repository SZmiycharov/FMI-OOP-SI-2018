- inline methods
- public inheritance - an is-a relationship
- runtime polymorphism
	- method overriding
	- virtual methods
- examples of overriding - GameAccount and GameAccountPlus classes //check GameAccount, GameAccountPlus and Source.cpp
- why make methods virtual when we expect them to be overriden? (pointers and objects)
- redefinition cautions
	- when redefining, keep the prototype of the base method the same
	- if the base method is overloaded, redefine all the overloaded methods
- protected access
	- when to use it
	- when NOT to use it
- abstract base class
	- meaning
	- usage
	- pure virtual functions
	- our first pure virtual class: BaseEllipse //check BaseEllipse.h
