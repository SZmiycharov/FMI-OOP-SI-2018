- abstract base class usage //see Abstract base class example
	- OOP design with abstract base classes
	- example: classes Ellipse and Circle //see Ellipse.h, Circle.h
	- array of objects from different types - second way (with pointer to the abstract class) //see Source.cpp
- inheritance and dynamic memory //see Inheritance and dynamic memory example
	- base class with dynamic memory allocation (DMA) - simple abstract class //see BaseDMA
	- derived class without dynamic memory //see NoDMA
		- check friend function in derived and base class
	- derived class with dynamic memory //see HasDMA
		- check constructor, destructor, copy constructor and assignment operator
